# Distributional-Semantics-Takes-the-SAT
Distributional semantics is one of the modern methods in natural language processing in solving tasks that require semantic knowledge of a word or relations between words. In this homework, we will learn how to create semantic representations of words from a corpus and how to use them in computational lexical semantic tasks.
